    <p> Hi, I'm Mya. I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. Growing up, I loved playing music and competing in sports. I also loved day tirps to Canada since it was only a 30 min drive away. </p>
    <h2> <strong> To Indy and beyond </strong></h2>
    <p> When I was a senior in high school, I moved to Indianapolis. I didn't really love Indy since it seemed boring, so I went to college in Delaware and Illinois. I discovered my educational path of choice to be Exercise Science with a plan to enter medical school afterward. Upon graduating, I moved to Nashville, and eventually ended up in New Orleans, Louisiana where I began to teach middle school </p>
<h3> Digging into coding</h3>
<p>While I enjoyed teaching math in New Orleans, I wanted to find something more directly related to my love of health, wellness and science. It was around that time when I began to look into the field of software development. </p>
<h4> Kenzie Academy</h4>
<p> While I no longer wanted to be a doctor, I still had a passion for health and wanted to use my knowledge of it. I decided to enroll in Kenzie Academy with hopes of using passion for health and wellness combined with my knowledge and skill of computers to make interactive tools for people seeking healthier lives. Although that is a VERY broad statement, that is where I am at currently. I'm not 100% sure what exactly I want to do, but I want to bring tech into the picture to make healthy lifestyles easier for people. I am hoping that my growing knowledge of software engineering will propel me into a breakthrough for the healh industry by making a tool (or a company) that makes living a healthy lifstyle easier to attain and sustain.</p>
